    <h2 noNumber>About This Note</h2>
    <p>This Note is constructed into multiple parts, each based on the content of a big subject or field. In each part are topics that were sorted in ascending difficulty based on Luke's personal experience, not necessarily based on the actual comprehension difficulty.</p>

    <p>When reading about a topic, it is expected that you will start to search about the terminologies as well as the concepts that were mentioned that you did not understand. A good place to begin looking up is in this guide itself before going to the internet. Despite there being topics that are "harder" than other topics, it does not mean that learning the latter is the requirement for the "more difficult" topics.</p>

    <p>This Note was written in a way to provide intuition to difficult topics, giving a different perspective to digest a concept. On other topics, this Note acts as a cheat sheet for a quick review before tests. Whatever the case might be, I hope you find this Note somewhat helpful on the path that you choose. It is recommended that you follow through on a topic to the end, as most of the time topics are structured in a way that does not repeat the mentioned notices more than once.</p>

    <p>The Note of Science Topics by Luke NK is free and unlicensed. The author simply suggests the astute reader share this with anybody who needs a different perspective to look at the topics. Knowledge is best used when everybody knows it.</p>
