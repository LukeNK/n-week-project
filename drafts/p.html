<h2>Waves</h2>
<h3>Describing a wave</h3>
<p>At a basic level, the trigonometric function sine is the foundation of all waves. If we take a "snapshot" of a wave at a specific time, we may get the following figure:</p>

</figure>

<p>What being left out of the figure above is the fact that a wave moves, or wave propagates. The speed that a crest will move is called <b>wave velocity</b>; it is a characteristic determined by the medium in which the wave is moving. For example, sound travels through air at approximately 340m/s, which means that if a thunder strikes (creates a crest), then a person standing 340 meters away will hear it after a second.</p>

<p>The next quantity that you will see very <i>frequently</i> is <b>frequency</b> $f$. This tells you how many events (in this case, a wave) happen in a second, with the SI unit is Hz. The reciprocal of this is <b>period</b> $T$, which tells you how often an event happen:
<eq>T = \frac{1}{f}</eq>
Another way to phrase period is: how many seconds before an event repeats.</p>

<p>Notice that since we have the wavelength describing (in meters) how far apart the crests are, while period is telling us how much we need to wait for the next crest (in seconds), we can find the propagation speed by dividing them. Therefore, we have the <b>Universal wave equation</b>:
<eq>
    v
    = \frac{&lambda;}{T}
    = &lambda;\cdot f
</eq>
If you think about this equation with frequency: because we are seeing the waves $f$ times per second, so if we multiply it by $&lambda;$, that means the first crest has traveled that much distance after a second.</p>

<p>Let's tackle the y axis in our <a href="#fig-p2"></a>. The most basic wave you will see is a transverse wave, which means the crests "transverse", but not the particles of the medium. You can imagine this like holding an end of a rope and swing it to create waves. As a part of the medium, your hand only move up and down to give the waves energy.</p>
